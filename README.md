# Payment Methods Testing Project

A personal project where I practiced integrating and testing payment methods like Stripe and PayPal. The project includes a basic cart screen and invoice screen to simulate a complete payment flow, allowing for testing different payment methods and exploring their features.

## Features 
- Stripe Integration: Set up to process payments using the Stripe API.
- PayPal Integration: Set up to process payments using the PayPal API.
- Cart Screen: A UI to simulate a shopping cart with items, quantities, and pricing.
- Invoice Screen: A UI to display an invoice with order details and total amount after a payment is made.
